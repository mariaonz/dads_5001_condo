# dads_5001_condo

This repository contains cleaned condominium rental data and a simple Streamlit
app for visualizing the information.

## Streamlit Visualization

1. Install the required packages (pandas, streamlit and plotly). You can use
   `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas streamlit plotly
   ```

2. Run the app with:

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

The interface lets you select a bedroom count and price range to explore the
relationship between the number of bedrooms and rental price.
